Backlinks, often referred to as inbound or incoming links, are a cornerstone of effective SEO strategies. These valuable digital connections occur when one website links to another. They serve as a vote of confidence, indicating to search engines that the linked-to content is credible and valuable. Backlinks not only enhance a website's authority and trustworthiness in the eyes of search engines but also drive referral traffic, expanding its online reach. In essence, the value of backlinks lies in their ability to boost search engine rankings, drive organic traffic, and establish a website's prominence within its niche or industry.
